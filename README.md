## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kevinrt0099/PUBG-DB-CONSOLE.git
   cd PUBG-DB-CONSOLE
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies: (upgrade to the newer version of pymysql if any)**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```
3. **Run the CLI:**

- In the mysqlcursor.py file, edit your mysql username and password. Then run:
  ```bash
   python3 main.py
  ```
- Also, Run test.sql file to import the PUBG-Database and work on it.

## Usage

Follow the interactive prompts to perform various database operations and explore the rich functionality of the PUBG Database Management CLI.

## Redis Caching

To `improve performance` and `reduce database load`, we have implemented Redis caching mechanism for read operations. Whenever an operation/query is performed, the data is `cached` in Redis. Subsequent read requests for the same data are served from the cache, thereby `reducing database queries` and `improving response times`.

### Testing with Redis

To test the Redis caching functionality, follow these steps:

1. **Start Redis Server:**
   Start the Redis server by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```
2. **Run Redis CLI:**
   Open another terminal window/tab and run the Redis CLI using the following command:
   ```bash
   redis-cli
   ```
3. **Test Redis Cache:**
   After performing read operations using the PUBG Database Management CLI, you can use the `Redis CLI` to check if the data is cached. Use the `HGETALL` command to retrieve all fields and values of a hash stored at a specified key. For example:
   ```bash
   HGETALL player:123
   ```
   Replace player:123 with the appropriate `cache key` based on your data structure and query.
